# OS Open Zoomstack SLDs

These are SLD files for OS Open Zoomstack. They were created using GeoServer.

*They have been designed to work with the data as it is supplied.*

## How to use
Choose your style; Outdoor, Road, Light or Night, and use the SLD files from the corresponding folder.
The same folder of SVG symbols (os-open-zoomstack-symbols) is required for all styles.

## Setup

You will need to copy the folder of SVGs (os-open-zoomstack-symbols) into the right location before applying the styles. In Geoserver on Windows this is typically *C:\Program Files (x86)\Geoserver 2.x.x\data_dir\styles*.

Create a Layer Group with the following layer order:
